# Quick Start:
1. Ensure the input file seq_input.txt is in the same folder.
2. Run the application iriseq.exe.
3. Open the generated HTML file to view the alignment results.


# Detailed Instructions:
1. Prepare the Input File:
- Create a text file named seq_input.txt and ensure it is in the same directory as the program.
- On the first line, type either "strict" or "relaxed" to set the analysis mode.
- On subsequent lines, input the DNA sequences, one sequence per line.

2. Run the Application:
- Execute iriseq.exe located in the same directory and wait approximately 10 seconds.

3. View the Results:
- After running the software, an HTML file named dna_alignment_visualization.html will be generated.
- Open the HTML file to access the following information:
    · Sequence Cards: Each sequence is displayed as a card, showing its name, length, and nucleotide sequence.
    · Paired Regions: The paired regions are color-coded, and a toggle button allows you to switch the display.
    · Alignment Information: Displays the length and GC content of each paired region.

# Important Notes:
1. Input File Format:
- The first line must specify the mode ("strict/relaxed").
- Ensure the file format is correct, with one sequence per line.
- Use a colon (:) to separate sequence names and sequences.
- Do not modify the file name.

2. Sequence Length:
- Processing very long sequences may slow down the alignment process.

3. RNA Analysis:
- This tool is designed for DNA due to its prevalent use in nanostructures and hybridization chain reactions. However, if RNA-related analysis is required, replace "U" in RNA sequences with "T" beforehand.
